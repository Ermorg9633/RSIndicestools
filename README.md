# RSIndicestools
What this tool does is convert band images from Landsat to different remote sensing indices. The Indices that are used Normalized Difference Water Index((Green - Nir)/(Green + Nir)), Coloration Index((Red - Blue)/Red), and Chlorophyll Vegetation Index((Nir/Green)-1).
In order to run the claculations, I had to import arcpy in order to do the calculations.
